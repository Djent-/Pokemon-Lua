Beginnings of an RPG engine, specifically made to make a clone of Pokemon Emerald. Because why not.

Uses Lua and LOVE 2D.

http://www.lua.org/
http://love2d.org/

To run:

1. put everything in a .zip
  
2. rename it [whatever].love
  
3. run the .love

PS: Don't just put everything in a folder and compress it. You need to compress the actual files, or you'll get an error.
  
You need Lua and LOVE installed for this to work, plebs.
